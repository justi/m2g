Sample Data
***********

If you don't have your own data, we have some `sample data <http://openconnecto.me/data/public/MR/m2g_v1_1_1/m2g_demo/>`_ that you can use to test your installation of the pipeline and begin to play with our statistical tools on.

Some information about these small graphs is as follows. This information can be obtained from either loading the graphs into Python or R using igraph, or using our graph explorer. Differences are computed as the Frobenius norm of the two adjacency matrices.
