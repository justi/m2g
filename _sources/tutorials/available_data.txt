Public Data
===========

Many publicly available datasets exist which contain diffusion and strutural MRI images in the form of nifti or dicom files, and contain diffusion protocol parameters. These images can be viewed in any standard nifti viewer, generally, such as ITKSnap, mricron, FSLview, Paraview, and others.

We process all publicly available data we can find, and put the graphs in our `graph services <http://http://openconnecto.me/graph-services/>`_ engine as well as the graphs and the remaining derivatives an s3 bucket which you can gain access to by contacting our user `support <mailto:support@neurodata.io>`_.
