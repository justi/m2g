Advanced Usage
**************
Here we will go through how to run the m2g pipeline incrementally, and look at the outputs along the way. Before beginning, please ensure that you have installed the pipeline either locally or on a cluster, and have checked out the basic usage page.

This `gist <https://gist.github.com/gkiar/39cedafe35d4813a04b0>`_ has been created (and is currently under development), which will be stepped through on this page of how to use the entire pipeline in fragments.

TODO: figures of outputs for steps where that makes sense
