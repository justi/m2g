Contributing
************

M2G is under active development.  To contribute new algoirthms, either get in touch with us directly, or clone our git repo and issue a pull request (TODO: how to do this).

Our workflows are modular and flexible, and so we are especially interested in incorporating tools that others use and find valuable for processing brains.
