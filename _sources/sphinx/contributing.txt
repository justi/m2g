Contributing
************

m2g is under active development.  To contribute new algoirthms, either get in touch with us directly, or clone our git repo and issue a pull request (TODO: how to do this).

Our workflows are modular and flexible, and so we are especially interested in incorporating tools that others use and find valuable for processing brains. 

We are also excited to deploy m2g on new datasets with interesting covariates to develop novel inference techniques.
